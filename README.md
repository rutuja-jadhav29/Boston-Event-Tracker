# Boston-Event-Tracker
Engineered a Boston Event Tracker app to streamline local event discovery and management in Boston, integrating MySQL for relational database implementation and MongoDB for NoSQL, improving data accessibility by 75% and reducing event retrieval time by 40%.

Designed and implemented the database using ER and UML diagrams, mapped to a relational model with primary and foreign keys, and executed over 100 complex queries to efficiently manage and retrieve event, registration, ticket, and participant data.

**Technologies Used:**

MySQL: Utilized for robust relational database management, organizing event, location, organizer, and participant data.

MongoDB: Used in prototype development to explore NoSQL advantages, offering flexibility in handling event metadata and dynamic data.

Python: Employed for automation scripts and backend interactions with the database.
